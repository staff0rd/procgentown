Typescript (vite + react + pixijs) application.

After making typescript changes build with `npm run build` and fix any errors.
After making changes you can run tests via `npm run test:run`.

Do the above in sub-agents so they run in parallel.

- If adding code to a file will considerably increase its length, consider splitting it into multiple files.
- Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- Never run `npm run dev` - the output runs in the browser which you won't see
